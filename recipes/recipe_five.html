    <h2>What is Authentic Filipino Pancit?</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe was given to me by my boss and her friend (Emmy and Judy) who
      are Filipino. This is a basic chicken pancit that has a flavor that is
      unbeatable.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons soy-based liquid seasoning (such as Maggi®), or to taste
      </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>½ large head cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 carrots, julienned</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add chicken thighs and
        boil until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, about 30
        minutes. Strain broth into a bowl to reserve. Shred chicken thighs using
        2 forks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place noodles in a large bowl and pour in hot chicken broth, adding hot
        water to cover if needed. Set aside until noodles are softened, 5 to 7
        minutes. Blanch noodles with cold water and drain well. Place into a
        bowl and add soy seasoning, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sesame oil. Mix
        well and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beef and 1/2 cup water; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5
        to 7 minutes. Season with black pepper and add more water as needed; do
        not let beef dry out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining olive oil in a skillet or large wok over medium-high
        heat. Saute garlic in the hot oil until it begins to brown, about 1
        minute. Add onion and cook for 2 minutes. Add chicken, cabbage, and
        carrots. Stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes; season with garlic salt. Mix
        chicken mixture with noodles, add soy seasoning to taste, and serve.
